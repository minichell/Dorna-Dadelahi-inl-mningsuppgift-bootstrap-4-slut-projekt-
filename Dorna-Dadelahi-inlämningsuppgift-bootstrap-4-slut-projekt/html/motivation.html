                Motivation is the drive to achieve your goals or needs. It is influenced by: how much you want the goal,
                what you will gain, and your personal expectations.</p>

                Motivation is important because it:

                provides you with goals to work towards,
                helps you solve problems,
                helps you change old habits,
                helps you cope with challenges and opportunities.</p>

                Most people struggle with motivation, but it is even more challenging if you have mental health issues such as depression or anxiety. Here are some tips:

                Set yourself one specific, achievable goal.
                Think about how to include that goal in your life, what you need do to make it happen, and then put a timeframe on it (such as a week).

                Make your goal part of your routine by using a diary or app for reminders.
                Positive self-talk is important and effective in managing depression or anxiety. Instead of saying 'I can't', say 'I can try'.
                Mindfulness helps keep you relaxed and focused.
                Start a class or join a support group. Support groups can be as effective as professional help.
                Reward yourself when you have completed a step or goal.</p>

                Here are some tips:

                Regularly review your goals and progress. Seeing progress is a great motivator in itself, and also improves your self-esteem.
                Continue to set new goals. Think about what you want to achieve next week, next month and next year. Tackle one goal at a time so you don’t feel overwhelmed.
                Keep the momentum up. </p>

                Setbacks are normal, but developing resilience can help you carry on and pick up where you left off. Here are some tips to help you find your motivation again:

                Review your goals and see if they are realistic in the timeframe you have set. You may need to break your goal down further into smaller and more achievable goals.
                Remember why you wanted to get motivated or reach that goal in the first place.</p>
